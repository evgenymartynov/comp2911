\section*{Class diagram}

Note that in the above diagram, we do not include method names for constructors
(they are implied and present in all classes).

Further, dependencies are drawn between the \texttt{TSPHeuristic} interface and
the rest of the classes, and not between \texttt{ConcreteTSPHeuristic} and the
rest of the classes. The dependencies are the same as for its interface.

Classes \texttt{Job} and/or \texttt{Point} are semi-utility classes, and hence
everything seems to rely on them. If we were to draw a real UML diagram and not
the one COMP2911 expects, we probably would not show these classes on this page.

Further, note the Strategy pattern in use for the \texttt{TSPHeuristic}.
I have included two different heuristics, but the code is wired to use the
\texttt{MinimalSpanningTSPHeuristic} implementation.
Note that any code duplication that you may observe between the two is
intentional, and \texttt{ConcreteTSPHeuristic} is included in my submission
purely as an example for the Strategy pattern.
You are advised to ignore its code otherwise, even though it is a fully
functional heuristic.
